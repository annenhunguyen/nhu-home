**Some thoughts on my first experience coming up with a hypothesis, confirming that the problem exists and is worth and getting the first users.**

Early entrepreneurship often presents a challenging journey, and it was especially difficult for me because my nature was introversion. These initial steps were the most daunting as they determine whether a concept will thrive or fade into obscurity. 

My first foray into entrepreneurship involved a sport training app idea. To gauge interest, we tried  interviewing people on the beach. This hands-on approach took me a lot of effort, yielded meager results because people did not want to talk or their answers were rush. 

After this experience, I decided to delve deeper and find out more about how to get the first users. Watching YCombinator YouTube videos was enlightening, confirming the importance of cold outreach.Conversion rates and user acquisition strategies became my focal points. However, I decided to put my spin on it and started sending cold emails and messages to potential users, allowing the message to be more concise.

The breakthrough finally arrived when we acquired our first user through a Facebook group. It was a thrilling moment, underscoring the importance of persistence and a bit of luck in the early stages of entrepreneurship. This small success not only validated our idea but also provided the motivation to keep pushing forward and expanding our user base. The difficulty of acquiring those first users was a valuable lesson that informed us more grit and persistence will be required in the future.
