**A reflection on how to work with different and sometimes difficult.**

Navigating the complex world of working with different personalities is a skill that I was glad I learned. I've had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse range of individuals, each with their unique quirks and characteristics. Two experiences, in particular, taught me the art of adaptation and understanding.

In one project, I was tasked with securing a clinical-grade storage space for all company's commercial and reference standard materials. The challenge was real, there were a multitude of stakeholders, including Supply Chain team, Manufacturing team, and Quality Assurance teams, who all had contrasting preferences and biases for sevela vendors. My main partner, a supply chain specialist, was unresponsive and seemingly disengaged. I attempted one-on-one conversations to understand his perspective, while cautiously documenting our interactions and ensuring my supervisor was aware of the situation. When this approach did not yield results, I escalated the issue to his supervisor. My caution paid off and we quickly gained the necessary support. The project was successfully delivered in time.

In another recent project where the main objective was to pass an important audit, I teamed up with P. P was a very capable, proud, and diligent technical lead. He had a great relationship with my predecesso and was wary of the newcomer, and thus not sharing many of his plans with me. However, unlike with T whom I also had a difficult time extracting information, I realized that P was passionate and protective of the project. My strategy was to be proactive, showing that I care as much as him, and to always check in and ask his opinions, showing that I respect and value his advice. Finally, I determined in advance that it was important to be patient and persistent. It took a few months, but now P usually initiates meetings with me to share new ideas or asks for help, and we have a good time working together. It was worth every bit of patience I put in.

The moral of these stories: to succeed in the art of working with diverse personalities:
**try to understand people's motivation and adapt.**

Who knows, it is very likely I will discover an interesting different perspective.
