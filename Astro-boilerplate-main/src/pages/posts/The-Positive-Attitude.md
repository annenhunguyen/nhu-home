> Consistent hard work and positude attitude, that's all you need.

I would like to start this post a little differently. My favorite college instructor, Jeff, used to work his saying into everyday stories so seamlessly, it stayed with me without effort. While I embraced the concept of hard work from the get-go, it took some real-world experience to truly appreciate the significance of a "positive attitude."

In my journey through various projects, I've discovered that the way we approach our work and interact with others have an impact. I have often received feedback from teammates acknowledging my upbeat, can-do attitude. However, I have also been caught off guard with sympathetic comments telling me that things would be fine - my hustling gave off a hectic nervous energy. It became evident that my own attitude can be picked up by and even rubbed off of other team members. Hence, it is wise to not only work hard but also to maintain my poise.

The power of poise goes beyond merely presenting a composed demeanor. It has the remarkable ability to keep people calm, especially in the face of challenges and uncertainty. This revelation highlighted the importance of balancing enthusiasm and composure.

I used to believe my attitude is my own, but it also forms people's perception of me and affects their attitudes. It will be the first step toward earning respect and winning influence.
