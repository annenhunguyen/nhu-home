**My first apartment was a blank canvas I have always wanted. This is to capture the thrill and pride of seeing developing something beautiful I loved.**

When I was a kid, my favorite game was imagining different designs for imaginary houses that I got to live in and decorate. Each house had some unique features that I loved: stone steps, an open air garden in the bathroom, a japanese sliding door and oven, etc. So creating the perfect living space has always been a journey that excites me. My first apartment was a blank canvas where I could freely express myself.

I hate clutter but adore coziness, so I decided those would be the two design principles. 

The process began with a sense of anticipation, and I planned, shopped, and put every piece of furniture together myself. Some steps were very fun (putting a small bookcase together using a beer bottle for example), but it was not all smooth and rosy. 

It took me 4 phone calls to track down my desk that was delivered to the wrong address (**lesson: just because one person says no, it doesn't mean the next person will say it too**), and another 20 minutes to lugged the package that was taller than me and weighed as much as me (or it certainly felt so at the time) back to my apartment on the third floor. 

There was a particular low moment when I had hammered the backboard of the bookcase backward, had to pry the tiny nails out without breaking the board, and hammered it back on. 

I was not the most talented designer and certainly not an accomplished handyman, but I was as proud of the apartment as any work project. It was more than just decorating; it was about perfecting the little details and trying my best to turn my vision into fruition. My apartment was a place where I could call my own and be myself.
