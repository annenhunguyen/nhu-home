### Some thoughts on places I have stayed on trips.

Traveling to new destinations is an exhilarating experience that brings both excitement and relaxation. And for me, the most vivid memories from traveling are often the experience of staying in a different place. 

Whether it's a quaint cottage in the countryside, a bustling city apartment, or a beachfront resort, each new accommodation is home for a few days. Each place offers a different character, a different atmosphere.

Sometimes the place itself is an adventure. I had woken up in a soft bed with a view of a magnificient magnolia tree, and fleed the place in a record 15 minutes because unfortunately the magnolia tree came with a damp garden and a cockroach. I had also stayed in arfully decorated apartment on tree lined New York street that was 10-minutes walk from the best bagel in the country - listening to Music of the Night there was unlike listening anywhere else.

Some places are not about constant excitement but seem to encourage you to find moments of relaxation. Whether it's staring into a sky full of stars, lounging in bed ina cozy evening by the fireplace, or simply taking in the serenity of a quiet countryside, different accommodations provide a perfect blend of adventure and reprieve.

Changing your place of stay while traveling is like opening a fresh chapter in your journey. Each location has its own stories to tell and its own unique ambiance. It's a reminder that the world is vast and diverse, offering a wide range of experiences to relish.

So, embrace the excitement of staying somewhere new, and allow yourself the serenity and relaxation it brings. Travel is about discovering the world, but it's also about discovering new facets of yourself through these diverse, refreshing environments.
