**Notes from a course about interior designing for writing. Take it with a grain of salt**

** Designs for writing
1. Color
- Blue is associated with Calm, Open, and Flowing

2. Space & Time
- Space: should be open and vast. If the space is limited, use artwork that creates abstract or vast open space.
- Time: story is old, so objects that have been around a while may encourages more creativity

3. Decor
- Shape: round = pleasure and ideas
- Sitting position: don't sit facing a wall. See the room, see the view, feel relaxed.
- Nature: materials and colors that bring nature in promotes well-being.

4. Ambience
- Sound: 70dB is the recommended volume. Choose non-demanding ambience sounds, like at coffee shop or relaxing jazz music.
- Lighting: dim light adds characters and promotes the imagination
- Orderliness: orderliness promotes a sense of control, but don't go overboard. Balance between the consciouness and unconsciousness

5. Posture
- Switch up between sitting, standing, and walking around to increase blood flow.
