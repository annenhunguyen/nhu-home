*This project was an early-development product for post-diagnosis cancer research. The product was a machine learning model that studied methylation pattern of DNA fragments from cancerous cells and aimed to detect clinical cases with residual disease post treatment. The project was sponsored by a pharmaceutical partner.*

## Quick Reflection
I learned a lot about how to work with smart, stubborn, and passionate people in this project . They also taught me the principles of machine learning and experimental designs. But most of all this project showed me how a team can function when they all believe in the product.

> know the details, be persistent, and have empathy

## What I did

- Led a team of ~ 70 cross-functional members to pass lab and software audits securing a $1M payment and enabling the next phase of a ~ $20M contract.
  - Problem:  The project lacked resources, cross-functional coordination, and accountability, while the team had only 4 weeks until the audit dates. 
  - Solution:  To achieve our goals within the limited time, I decided to employ an informal Agile framework, which sped up the decision making process and allowed for frequent communication with team members to integrate results and promote accountability. 
  - Result: The team passed the audit; my personal performance led to multiple contract extensions worth > $800K.

- Uncovered and solved the underlying misalignment between the pharmaceutical partner’s expectation and the team’s understanding of deliverables. 
  - Problem: The project was being considered for termination due to the pharmaceutical partner's dissatisfaction.
  - Solution: I hosted several small meetings with both my team members and the partner team members and identified the key issue that our team had failed to establish basic machine learning principles before presenting the results to the partner, leading to false understanding of the results and demands for extra testing. We restructured all reports, redefined the terms, and built a universal "knowdledge sharing' slide deck for future use.
  - Result: This led to securing a contract extension and achieving Q3 target revenue, as well as improved a strategic relationship with a demanding partner.

- Estimated resource and budget for scenario planning for 6 study design variations, which leads to revision of corporate 2022-2023 goals
