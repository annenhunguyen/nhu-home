## Quick Reflection
The idea for Flowdove started while we were working on another project and needed a simple video trimming tool, but every tool out there asked you to sign up and pay. We could not find the tools we wanted, so decided to make them. 

Along the way, I realized that it was not enough to create a tool, or even a great tool. It has to become a product. People have to *know* about your product. 

So there is a long way to go...

## What I did
