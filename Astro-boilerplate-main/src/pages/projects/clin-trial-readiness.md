*This project consists of leading manufacturing activities for a phase 1 clinical trial and establishing a clinical-grade storage facility for commercial launch. The project was at a startup biopharmaceutical. *

## Quick Reflection
This project taught me how to work with different types of people, from those who are not so happy to put in the effort, to those who remember a "thank-you" until the day I leave.

## What I did

- Drug Supply:  Drove execution and risk mitigation activities to save ~$1M worth of drug product from expiring early.
  - Problem:  The drug supply for an ongoing clinical trial was at risk because the drug lot in use would expire in 6 months and the workflow to release a new lot or to extend the expiry was significantly delayed. 
  - Solution:  I mapped out all deliverables and dependencies, met with each vendor individually to understand what would motivate them, and negotiated both internally and externally with six domestic and international vendors to resolve bottlenecks. 
  - Result:  The team not only successfully extended the expiry of the current lot but also released a new lot 3 weeks ahead of schedule, adding flexibility and reducing risk for the patients in the ongoing study.
- Storage Vendor:  Led activities to identify a vendor and launch a new storage facility for critical reference standard material.
  - Problem:  Some stakeholders were in favor of a vendor they had known while other stakeholders strongly disfavored the same vendor, and some team members were underperforming.
  - Solution:  I met with each stakeholder to establish the requirements for the storage, sent out multiple RFPs to find the most qualified vendor through a formal comparison process, and talked to all team members regularly to identify delays and escalate if necessary.
  - Result:  The storage facility was qualified and launched in time to accommodate an unexpected relocation of critical reference standard material.
